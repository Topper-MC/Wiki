You can cache the player name by installing [LastLoginAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/66348/).

Topper will handle the fetching of player names from the plugin automatically.

This is useful if your server has a lot of players and you want to avoid the overhead of fetching player data from your
server every time you need to see the player's name.
