This will quickly introduce you to the basics of the plugin, by creating a simple leaderboard.

## Add a Top Holder

The unit that stores and manages the leaderboard data is called a `Top Holder`. Inside the `Top Holder`, you can define
a `Value Provider`, which is responsible for providing the value of each entry in the leaderboard.

We will start by creating a `Top Holder` named `jump` and defining a `Value Provider` to count the number of times the
player jumps. The `Value Provider` we will use is called `Statistic Provider`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SpigotMC">

Open the `config.yml` file from the plugin's folder (`plugins/Topper/config.yml`), head to the `holders` section, and
add the following configuration:

```yaml
holders:
  jump: # The name of the Top Holder
    type: statistic # The type of the Value Provider, which in this case is a Statistic Provider
    statistic: jump # The name of the statistic that will be used to count the number of jumps
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="FabricMC">

Open the `config.json` file from the mod's folder (`config/topper/config.json`), head to the `holders` section, and add
the following configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "holders": {
    "jump": { // The name of the Top Holder
      "type": "statistic", // The type of the Value Provider, which in this case is a Statistic Provider
      "statistic": "minecraft:jump" // The name of the statistic that will be used to count the number of jumps
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That is all you need to do, now the plugin is ready to start counting the number of jumps.

Open your server terminal and type `/reloadtop` to apply the changes.

## Display the Top Holder

There are several ways to display the leaderboard of a `Top Holder`. In this case, we will simply display the top 10
players in the chat.

To do this, type the following command:

```
/gettop jump 10
```

## Add another Top Holder

Now, let's add another `Top Holder` to show the amount of diamond ores a player has mined.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SpigotMC">

Open the `config.yml` file from the plugin's folder (`plugins/Topper/config.yml`), head to the `holders` section, and
add the following configuration:

```yaml
holders:
  jump:
    type: statistic
    statistic: jump
  mine:
    type: statistic
    statistic: mine_block
    material: diamond_ore
```

`mine_block` needs a block material to work. Hence, we added the `material` field to specify the block material, which
in this case is `diamond_ore`.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="FabricMC">

Open the `config.json` file from the mod's folder (`config/topper/config.json`), head to the `holders` section, and add
the following configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "holders": {
    "jump": {
      "type": "statistic",
      "statistic": "minecraft:jump"
    },
    "mine": { // The name of the Top Holder
      "type": "statistic", // The type of the Top Holder
      "statistic-type": "minecraft:mined", // The type of the statistic
      "statistic": "minecraft:diamond_ore" // The name of the statistic
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Open your server terminal and type `/reloadtop` to apply the changes.

Now, you can display the top 10 players who have mined the most diamond ores by typing the following command:

```
/gettop mine 10
```
