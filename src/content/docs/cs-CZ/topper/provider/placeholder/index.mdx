This is a provider that allows you to use PlaceholderAPI placeholders as values in the Top Holder.

## Format

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="SpigotMC">
    > [!NOTE]
    > Requires [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

    ```yaml
    holders:
      <holder-name>:
        # The type of the provider
        type: placeholder
        # The placeholder used to get the value
        placeholder: <placeholder>
        # Whether the placeholder should be parsed for online players only (Those who are in the server). Default is true.
        # If set to false, the placeholder will be parsed for all players, even those who are offline.
        # 
        # Setting "online" to true ONLY means the plugin would stop updating values for players who are not in the server.
        # It DOES NOT mean the plugin would remove the value if the player is offline.
        # It DOES NOT mean that is necessary to set it to false to make it work with offline-mode / cracked servers.
        online: <true/false>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Setting `online` to `true` **ONLY** means the plugin would stop updating values for players who are not in the server.
    > It **DOES NOT** mean the plugin would remove the value if the player is offline.
    > It **DOES NOT** mean that is necessary to set it to `false` to make it work with offline-mode / cracked servers.
  </TabItem>
