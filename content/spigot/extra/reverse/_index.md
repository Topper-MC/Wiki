title = "Reversed Leaderboard"
+++

By default, the top leaderboard is measured by the player with the highest value first. If you want to change that (e.g. show the player with the least value first), you can set `reverse` to `true`.

```yaml
holders:
  jump:
    <your other settings>
    reverse: true
```
