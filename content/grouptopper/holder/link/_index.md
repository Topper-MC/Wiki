First, you add some settings to link a Top Holder to this Group Holder, which means the Group Holder will listen to the Top Holder for value changes and updates.

```yaml
holders:
  jump_group: # The group holder name
    top: jump # The top holder it will be based on
```

This example will set that the Group Holder `jump_group` will listen to the Top Holder `jump` ([Click here if you don't know what `jump` is]({{% ref "topper/quickstart" %}})).

{{% notice style="info" title="Link a holder from TimedTopper" %}}
If you want to use a holder from [**TimedTopper**]({{% ref "timedtopper" %}}), you can set the `top-type` field to `timedtopper`. Then you can set the `top` field to the name of the holder you want to use.

```yaml
holders:
  jump_group:
    top-type: timedtopper # The type of the top holder. In this case, it will use TimedTopper
    top: jump # The top holder it will be based on
```
{{% /notice %}}
