The query system is the same as the one used in Topper, with the addition that:
- the `<holder>` is the name of the Group Holder speficied in the configuration file of GroupTopper.
- the `top_name` query returns the name of the Group
- the `top_key` query returns the UUID of the owner of the Group

Refer to the [Topper Query]({{% ref "spigot/query" %}}) page for more information.
